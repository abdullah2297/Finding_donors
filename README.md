# Finding_donors

Happy Weekend helping The Charity to Find Donors ^_^

Through this Notebook:
1- Exploratory Data Analysis
2- Data Preparation
3- Data Preprocessing
4- Choose appropriate performance measures (Precision-Recall, AUC-ROC, F1)
5- Model Training and Evaluation (SVC, KNN, SGDC, Decision Tree)
6- Feature selection using RandomForest

Objectives:
employed several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census.

then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data.

The goal of this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.

Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.
